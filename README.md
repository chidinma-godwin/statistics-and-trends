# Analysis of the Economic Performance of Different Regions Using World Bank Data

The GDP per capita, Gross National Expenditure, Inflation, Total Natural Resources Rents, Net Exports of goods and services, and Net Migration across 6 regions from 1996 to 2020 from World Bank data were examined to observe the trend and correlation between them and how they differ between regions.

The analysis shows that North America had the highest GDP per capita, the least average inflation rate but trade deficit throughout the observed years, while Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest GDP per capita and the highest average inflation rate, which could be a reason for its negative net migration all through the years. Correlations were also found between some of the factors, these correlations were examined in North America and Sub-Saharan Africa.
